    <p><b>Hey! I'm Murto.</b></p>
    <p>
      I'm a 4A student at the University of Waterloo studying Biotechnology & Economics, with a focus on 
      computational biology and data science. I'm passionate entrepreneurship and using biology as a technology to solve
      real-world problems, and I'm always looking for opportunities to learn and grow in this field.
    </p>
    <p>
    I'm currently working on a few projects, including:
    <ul>
      <li>a protein that prevents coffee from staining your teeth</li>
      <li>an embryo micrograph classifier</li>
    </ul>
    I'm also working on a few side projects, including this blog and a newsletter.
    </p>
    <p>
      In my spare time, I enjoy writing, staying fit, Muay Thai, and reading about the latest in tech and biotech.
