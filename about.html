        <p>
          <b>Hey! I'm Murto.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm a final term student at the University of Waterloo studying <span class="hand-drawn">Biotechnology & Economics</span>, 
          with a focus on computational biology and data science. 
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm passionate about entrepreneurship and <span class="hand-drawn">using biology as a technology</span> to solve
          real-world problems, so I'm always looking for opportunities to learn and grow in the world of compbio. I'm also
          a huge travel enthusiast and love exploring new cities. I've been fortunate enough to visit over 
          <span class="hand-drawn">10 countries</span> last year alone, and I can't wait to see more of the world.
        </p>
        
        <p>I'm currently working on a few projects, including:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>a protein that <span class="hand-drawn">prevents coffee stains</span> on teeth</li>
          <li>finding natural <span class="hand-drawn">alpha-glucosidase inhibitors</span> for diabetes treatment</li>
          <li>developing a deep learning model to <span class="hand-drawn">predict peptide-IDP binding sites</span></li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>
          In my spare time, I enjoy writing, staying fit, Muay Thai, and reading about the latest in tech and biotech.
