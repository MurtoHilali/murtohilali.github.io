        I'm a 4A student at the University of Waterloo studying Biotechnology & Economics, with a focus on 
        computational biology and data science. I'm passionate entrepreneurship and using biology as a technology to solve
        real-world problems, and I'm always looking for opportunities to learn and grow in this field.

        I'm currently working on a few projects, including:
        - a protein that prevents coffee from staining your teeth
        - an embryo micrograph classifier
        - an app that checks the reliability of a webpage's sources

        I'm also working on a few side projects, including this blog and a newsletter.

        In my spare time, I enjoy writing, staying fit, Muay Thai, and reading about the latest in tech and biotech.
