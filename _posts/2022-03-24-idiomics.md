**[Idiomics](https://idiomics.com/)** is a collection of illustrations I made during the pandemic to help add a bit of life to the articles I was writing on Medium.

<div style="max-width: 100%;">

Throughout the whole process, I managed to practice a few important skills:
- eCommerce copywriting and landing page design
- Promotional video creation
- Product Hunt (yes, this is a skill)

Not to mention the actual drawing itself. I've made all the illustrations free to download and use.

I think there's a lot I learned from building Idiomics. Here are my key takeaways:
- If you do something valuable for yourself, it's probably valuable to other people too.
- I had this project on the backburner for about 2 and a half years before I finall pressed publish. Ship!
- Selling illustrations is hard! This project was never really meant to generate revenue (and trust me â€” it didn't). But it's because it didn't solve a pressing enough problem.
