**[Idiomics](https://idiomics.com/)** is a collection of illustrations I made during the pandemic to help add a bit of life to the articles I was writing on [Medium](https://murto.medium.com).

This was also my first ever launch on Product Hunt — can't really say you're in tech without one of these, right?

### Skills
Throughout the whole process, I managed to practice **a few important skills**:
- eCommerce copywriting and landing page design
- Promotional video creation
- Product Hunt (yes, this is a skill)

Not to mention the actual drawing itself. I've made all the illustrations free to download and use.
### Key Takeaways
I think there's a lot I learned from building Idiomics. Here are my key takeaways:
- **Sharing is caring:** If you do something valuable for yourself, it's probably valuable to other people too.
- **Just ship it:** I had this project on the backburner for about 2 and a half years before I finall pressed publish. Ship!
- **Selling illustrations is hard:** This project was never really meant to generate revenue (and trust me — it didn't). But it's because it didn't solve a pressing enough problem.
